Local-only's average time taken by each global epoch: 0 min 1.37 sec.          
Local-only's total running time: 0 h 10 m 5 s.                                 
==================== Local-only Experiment Results: ====================       
Display format: (before local fine-tuning) -> (after local fine-tuning)        
 So if finetune_epoch = 0, x.xx% -> 0.00% is normal.                           
 Centralized testing ONLY happens after model aggregation, so the stats between
'->' are the same.
