==================== Local-only Experiment Results: ====================       
Display format: (before local fine-tuning) -> (after local fine-tuning)        
 So if finetune_epoch = 0, x.xx% -> 0.00% is normal.                           
 Centralized testing ONLY happens after model aggregation, so the stats between
'->' are the same.
